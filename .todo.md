## Action Items by Priority

### ðŸš¨ Critical (Immediate Action Required)

1. **Complete bulk power operations** in Dashboard
   - Implement bulk VM power on/off functionality
   - Should have been part of PR #11 completion

2. **Implement user management APIs** for both Organizations and VDCs
   - User invitation, role updates, and user removal
   - Essential administrative functionality missing from core features

3. **Complete user profile API integration**
   - Password changes, preferences, and security settings
   - Core user functionality that should be working

### ðŸ“‹ Medium Priority (Next Sprint)

4. **Plan Catalogs implementation** for Phase 4
   - Already properly deferred with placeholder
   - Should be next major feature after VM management completion

5. **Plan Organization Analytics** for Phase 4
   - Already properly deferred with placeholder
   - Part of monitoring and analytics features

### ðŸ”§ Low Priority (Technical Debt)

6. **Add external error tracking**
   - Operational improvement
   - Can be addressed during performance optimization phase

## Technical Debt Assessment

- **High Technical Debt**: User management and bulk operations have UI implemented but lack API integration
- **Medium Technical Debt**: User profile features partially implemented
- **Low Technical Debt**: Properly planned future features with placeholders

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Create focused PRs to complete the missing API integrations for user management and bulk operations
2. **Short-term**: Ensure all Phase 3 features are fully complete before moving to Phase 4
3. **Long-term**: Implement proper feature flagging to avoid half-implemented features in production

## Notes

- The project shows good planning with proper placeholder comments for future features
- However, there's a pattern of UI implementation without complete API integration
- This suggests either missing backend APIs or incomplete frontend development
- Future PRs should ensure both UI and API integration are complete before marking features as done
