# Testing SPA Routing Fix

## How to test the fix

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Serve the application:
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

3. Test direct navigation to routes:
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:8080/dashboard` - should load dashboard
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:8080/vms` - should load VMs page
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:8080/organizations` - should load organizations page
   - Any other route should also work without 404 errors

## What was fixed

The issue was that the `serve` package was not configured for Single Page Application (SPA) routing. When users navigated directly to URLs like `/dashboard`, the server would look for a file at that path instead of serving the main `index.html` file and letting React Router handle the routing.

The fix adds the `-s` (single) flag to the serve command, which rewrites all not-found requests to `index.html`, allowing React Router to handle client-side routing properly.

## Technical details

- **Before**: `serve dist -l 8080` - would return 404 for routes like `/dashboard`
- **After**: `serve dist -l 8080 -s` - falls back to `index.html` for all routes
- **Alternative**: Created `serve.json` config file for more complex configurations if needed
