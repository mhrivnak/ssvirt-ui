# Workflow

- Be sure that any new API endpoint you implement is listed in the vmware cloud director API documentation, which is linked in plan.md, and that your implementation exactly matches the documentation.
- Don't move on to the next task until I explicitly tell you to.
- Do not push changes to the main branch without confirmation.
