# Workflow

- Be sure that any new API endpoint you implement is listed in the vmware cloud director API documentation, which is linked in plan.md, and that your implementation exactly matches the documentation.
- Don't move on to the next task until I explicitly tell you to.
- Do not push changes to the main branch without confirmation.
- Run tests, lint, and format checking before commiting code.
- Do not commit code that has any `TODO` or similar comments. You must implement any missing code before commit.
- do not look at or consider any API documentation that was created by or is served by broadcom or vmware.
- use this link for API documentation unless given specific instructions otherwise: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhrivnak/ssvirt/refs/heads/main/docs/api-reference.md
